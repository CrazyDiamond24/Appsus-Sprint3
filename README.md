# AppSus

AppSus is a responsive web application built in Vue.js, that consists of two main apps: a Notes app and a Mail app. This project was developed by a team of two as part of their learning journey at Coding Academy. 

I took the lead on the development of the Notes app, which is inspired by Google Keep. It allows users to take notes, create to-do lists, upload images, and add video notes. The app features all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, meaning you can add, edit, delete, and search for notes.

Additionally, I was responsible for the UX/UI design of most of the other pages, working to create a cohesive and intuitive user experience throughout the application.

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of the application:

### Home Page

The home page is where you can navigate between the two apps. It features AI images of, well, horses (susim) using the app in Van Gogh style, and a clean design with a color scheme that's easy on the eyes.

### Notes App

This is the app that I focused on.
